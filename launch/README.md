# Launch

This folder contains two subfolders, one for python scripts, the other for bash scripts. 

For each type, the model_run script runs the model to calculate the impacts.

The bash script launches climada and allows to run the model from the command line with different inputs, 
and the python script translate these inputs in python and calls the monte carlo impact calculation.
