# Launch

This folder contains two subfolders, one for the python scripts, the other for bash scripts. 

For each type, the model_run script runs the impact calculations

The bash script launches climada and allows to run the model from the command line with different inputs, 
and the python script translate these inputs in python and calls the monte carlo impact calculation.

the 'test_mortality_run.py' and 'test_productivity_run.py' scripts allow to run the model locally only for one climate simulation,
and for the canton of Zurich.
