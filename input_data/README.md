# Input Data

Data for the impact functions, exposures and the shapefiles to get specific cantons. 
The CH2018 data to compute the hazard must be provided externally.

For mortality, two types of exposures are saved, those calculated based on cantonal values for the number of death
and the total population (1), as well as those based on national values (2).
